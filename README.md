/r/CFB Gameday Thread bot
======
After a summer of getting involved with the community at [/r/baseball](http://reddit.com/r/baseball) and [/r/astros](http://reddit.com/r/astros),
I came back to the community of [/r/CFB](http://reddit.com/r/CFB) where the game threads are not automatically updated with a box score and I was forced
to go to like ESPN or something to check stats. It was annoying, anyway, I will be making a bot that does this for me. Hopefully the mods use this bot :(
This readme will be updated as the progress of this bot continues.
